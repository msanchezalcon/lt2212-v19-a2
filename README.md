## Results and discussion


### Vocabulary restriction.
Top 50 words.
I chose this little amount of data to be able to see noticeable differences, since the corpus is very large in comparison. By restricting the the vocabulary to the top 50, the program uses the most common words, thus making a much bigger difference in the classification task.

### Result table

(in a separate pdf file called "result_table.pdf")

### The hypothesis in your own words
In this assigment we are comparing the similarity among documents in terms of their words. This comparison is done through cosine similarity, which is a value between 0-1. The closer the cosine similarity between two documents is to 1, the more similar they are and therefore should be classificed as same topic, or at least related. The more amount of data is filtered in, the more occurrence of different words, and less of the previous ones (occurrence flattens). By restricting vocabulary size and setting the tf-idf we find the most relevant words to a topic. In the same way, by truncating we reduce the size of vectors with the same consequence.


### Discussion of trends in results in light of the hypothesis
